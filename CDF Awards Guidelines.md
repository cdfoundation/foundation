# 🏆 CDF Community Awards
The Continuous Delivery Foundation recognizes community members, developers, and advocates that work hard to make this community great and push for Continuous Delivery advancements.

We traditionally have the following awards, awarded at our annual cdCon event:
* **Continuous Enthusiast**: The special award for the community contributors. When you think of the CDF community, this person should be on the shortlist, because they're everywhere!
* **Top CDF Ambassador**: A community champion for the continuous delivery space. This individual helps spread awareness of the CDF and its projects. The CDF Ambassador leverages multiple platforms, both online as well as speaking engagements, driving interest and excitement around the ecosystem. Must be part of the active Ambassador Cohort.
* **Top CDF Contributor**: Recognizes excellence of technical contributions to the CDF and its projects. This individual commits key pieces to projects and, more importantly, contributes in a way that benefits the project neutrally as a whole.
* **Top Doc(umenter)**: This award recognizes excellence in documentation contributions to the CDF and its projects. Outstanding technical documentation is one of the best ways projects can lower the barrier to contribution.
* **Top CDF End User**: The special award for the CDF End User Companies. This company embodies Continuous Delivery in the enterprise and strives to improve its processes. Their team members also drive important open conversations with other companies and CDF committees.

## Project Awards
Each CDF project conducts their own selection process for their Most Valuable Contributor Award. 

Graduated projects (currently Jenkins and Tekton) have three awards.
* Most Valuable Advocate
* Most Valuable Contributor
* Security MVP

## Nominations 

The nominations for CDF Awards are done directly under corresponding issues created in cdfoundation/foundation repository. Anyone can nominate someone a CDF award.

## Voting
The voting will be done via a Google Form. Members of the Outreach Committee, the Technical Oversight Committee (including Project Representatives), and the Governing Board vote to determine the winners of the 5 CDF awards: Continuous Enthusiast, Top CDF Ambassador, Top CDF Contributor, Top Doc(umenter), and Top CDF End User. The CDF Ambassadors are eligible to vote for the Top CDF Ambassador Award. Only 1 vote per company will be counted when tallying up the final results to determine each award winner.

## Project Awards
The projects are responsible for running their own award process, including nomination and voting.

## Eligibility
All community members are eligible to be nominated for all of the award categories based on their contributions except for the category in which they won the award during the last year. The reason for this is that there are many people involved in the success of the foundation and its projects. We want to make sure that more than one person is recognized for their efforts. 

## Winners
The winners are announced during the yearly cdCon event. The breakdown of votes is not disclosed, however members of the community will be invited to take part in the awards process as a CDF Award Officer (two volunteers per year) to observe nomination and voting process to ensure the transparency and sanctity of the award process.
