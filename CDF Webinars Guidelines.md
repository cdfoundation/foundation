## Who can host a webinar ##

* Premier Members can host 1 webinar per quarter.
* General Members can host 1 webinar every 6 months.
* End User members cannot hold a webinar.
* Graduated and incubating projects can hold a webinar twice a year. These webinars can communicate release launch details or provide a project update.
* CDF Ambassadors can hold a webinar as it fits their schedule.
* CDF SIGs can host 1 webinar a year.

* CDF Member Webinars will have "Member Webinar" preceeding their webinar title.
* CDF Project Webinars will have "Project Webinar" preceeding their webinar title.
* CDF Ambassador Webinars will have "Ambassador Webinar" preceeding their webinar title.
* CDF SIG Webinars will have "SIG Webinar" preceeding their webinar title.

## Webinar content guidelines ##

* The simplest guideline is that webinar topics should be comparable to what would be accepted in a CDF event talk.
* No straight product pitches. It is okay to do a comparison of part of the landscape (e.g., CD orchestration), but webinars should not be promotional.
* Any platforms, tools, or technologies you are describing must be open source and work with CDF projects.

## Webinar Calendar ##

The development of the webinar calendar is currently in progress and will become available as soon as possible.

Please reach out to CDF team via webinars@cd.foundation to discuss possible webinar dates.

## How to pick a topic ##

* The purpose of the webinars is to educate the community and align your business with important thought-leadership topics.
* The audience is interested in technical demos that help them solve problems and want to be able to ask your expert questions.
* Our audience spans from developers, architects, CIOs, and CTOs. Topics should be tailored for which of those audiences you're trying to target.
* We are emphasizing SEO optimization this year to drive more registrations and views after the fact, so please take some extra time to make sure your abstract is highlighting important keywords. We'll be making suggestions as well.
* Top Performing Topics: Monitoring/Observability, CDF Project Updates or Intros, CD, Developer Experience, Deployment Strategies, Edge Compuing, Security (ex. RBAC), ML/AI.

## Webinar Promotion & Prep Details ##

* Upon receipt of the abstract and the webinar being set up in Zoom, the hosting company will receive a link to the webinar registration page. The hosting company should use that link to promote the webinar.
* The webinar is added to the CDF webinar page.
* CDF promotes webinars via website, email and Twitter.
* Our most successful webinars are when the presenting company helps promote in addition to CDF promotion. We are often able to double our attendance in these cases.

## Webinar: Presentations ##
* 1 week prior to your webinar, send your webinar presentation to [Webinar](mailto:webinars@cd.foundation). All presentations must be reviewed prior to the webinar.
* Logos:
  * Obsolete, low-res (i.e., pixelated), and malformatted logos are an epidemic among conference presentations. High-res logos of many CD projects, products, and companies are available in the [CDF Landscape](https://l.cd.foundation/). All logos are in the card mode and can be found with Cmd-F or Cntl-F from your browser. Note that all of these logos are stacked, not horizontal, and include the name. The logos are all the most current (or you can open a pull request if they’re not).
  * Please see the [CDF Style Guide](https://github.com/cdfoundation/foundation/blob/main/CDF%20Style%20Guide.md) which covers things like abbreviating Kubernetes as K8s not K8 or K8S as well as the proper capitalization of projects like gRPC and containerd.

## Webinar Moderator ##

CDF will provide a moderator for the webinar. The moderator is typically a CDF ambassador or a CDF staff member.

The moderator is responsible for covering the housekeeping items and helping the presenter manage the Q&A.


## Webinar: Day-Of Details ##

* Soundcheck: ½ hour before the webinar starts
* Live Webinar: Tuesday 10am-11am PT, Wednesday 10am-11am PT, Thursday 9am-10am PT, Friday 10am - 11am PT
* Typical timing of the webinar - approximately 5 minute introduction, 45 minute presentation, 10 minutes of Q&A
* A CDF Ambassador or CDF staff will help moderate (introduction, feeding questions to the presenter)
* Webinar Platform: Zoom

After the webinar, registration numbers and a link to the webinar on YouTube will be shared with the company hosting the webinar.

Please note: We are unable to share the list of leads or include any promotions with the intention of driving leads.
