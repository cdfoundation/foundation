# CDF Blog Guidelines #

## Content ##

The Continuous Delivery Foundation (CDF) blog serves as a channel to share CI/CD knowledge and thought leadership. View [previous blogs](https://cd.foundation/news/blog/).

Accepted content:
* Articles about graduated or incubating CDF projects
* Technical content and how-tos about open source technologies related to CI/CD
* Stories about CI/CD and CDF project deployments
* Use cases and success stories
* Industry insight into CI/CD adoption
* Reports from CDF events 

Other topics are welcome, but must have a direct link to the CDF community.  

We accept content from CDF members, project maintainers, ambassadors, and the general community.

## Audience ##

The CDF blog audience is developers, IT operators, as well as CI/CD and open source enthusiasts.

## To Keep in Mind ##
* Posts from members must be vendor-neutral. The post may mention a vendor’s name if it relates to specific open source projects, project deployments, adoption paths, their hosting of an in-person event or speaking at an event, or other indications of meaningful participation in the community, but it shouldn’t feel like an advertisement for your services or company. We do not accept announcements or press releases to the CDF blog.
* The most interesting posts are those that teach or show how to do something in a way others may not have thought of. 
* Blog posts that show hurdles that were encountered and explain how they were overcome often do very well- our community is looking to learn.
* How-to blogs and blogs with technical content are of interest to the developer audience in the community.
* Content on how to choose between different technologies and how to accommodate different legacy issues and cloud platforms is a good way to highlight your learnings and share with the community. 
* When showing upstreaming of a patch fixing an issue for others, link back to the GitHub issue, so readers can follow along. 
* Critical commentary or broad issues must be approached with sensitivity, professionalism, and tact in a way that is beneficial and positive for the community.
