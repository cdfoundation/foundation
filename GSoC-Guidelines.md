## How to set up a Payoneer account
Google uses Payoneer to pay Google Summer of Code Contributors and Organizations. Payoneer is a fast and convenient way to receive payments globally.
Included in your payment is $500 per GSoC contributor for your organization called the 'org stipend'. One payment is sent to the org, and if the org wishes to disburse the funds to their mentors they are welcome to do that on their own.
We kindly ask that you review and act on the following information:
Please submit the GSoC Payment Request Form to https://members.cd.foundation/  (please allow 5 days processing time)
Please understand that LF will receive the GSoCfunds for your project directly to our Payoneer's account, then we can disburse the funds once received.
